00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,753
Morevna Project presents

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,522
“Pepper & Carrot” is an animated adaptation of a comic 

3
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:13,234
created by a French artist David Revoy.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:17,536
David makes the comic and our team produces its animated version.

5
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:20,085
Now we are working on a new episode,

6
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,641
And it is already at the phase of Production.

7
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,251
I can describe in general terms the steps we go trough

8
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:31,584
To make a comic an animated one.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,444
Firstly, the director makes a draft animation

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,273
out of moveless pictures, decides on the duration of each frame

11
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:47,614
and on the general directions of moves made by the characters and other objects in the frame.

12
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:52,110
The author draws some picture and it does already imply 

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,270
Some movement in itself. The director has to track this movement

14
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:59,180
and to understand what did the author mean by it.

15
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:02,724
Meanwhile we record a draft voice acting

16
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:06,875
We just record reading the text aloud.

17
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,391
Good morning, Sir

18
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,868
Could I have eight of these pumpkin stars? 

19
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:13,851
Here. 60 Ko for all of them.

20
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:16,169
oops...

21
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:21,362
I am sorry I will have only four of them.

22
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:22,553
Rhrr!

23
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:25,849
We read aloud and record the words to understand

24
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:29,593
How much time the dialog would take and get its tempo right.

25
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,325
Simultaneously, we choose the music.

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,831
That is to say we create a soundtrack draft and

27
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,139
Combine it with the draft visual.

28
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,331
That's what they call an animatic.  

29
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:43,482
It gives us the overall picture

30
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:47,507
and the general idea of what we need to do.

31
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,230
The potion contest

32
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:53,059
Lucky me, I still have a whole day to prepare!

33
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:55,409
Let's win this challenge!

34
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,980
Sometimes we add some new scenes, we discuss how to get

35
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:02,508
the best of some things that can be perfectly understandable in the comic

36
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,291
But need some correction when turned into an animation. 

37
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:10,316
We have the comic, and it has already been directed, hasn't it?

38
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:14,341
The artist drew all of these scenes and arranged them in the right order.

39
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:19,178
However while editing I understand that some of these scenes

40
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:24,125
need an interlink to connect the previous one to the next.

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,204
That why sometimes I have to come up with something and to draw some extra details.

42
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,378
Take for instance this scene with Saffron and coins.

43
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,354
I thought it would be great to take a close-up

44
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,775
of them and her tossing them.

45
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,338
There's nothing of this in the comic, but it links the frames

46
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:48,862
that were there quite well.

47
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,894
All these done, we take up the phase of Production.

48
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,919
I am the director of the project. I know which aim

49
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:59,632
every single scene serves. Having arranged all of them, I assign

50
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:03,657
the tasks for the animators and artists.

51
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,077
Every picture is to be cut into several parts.

52
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:15,861
The characters should be separated from the background.

53
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:20,569
Then we must add some details to the objects or characters, 

54
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:23,905
As, characters removed from the background,

55
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,513
We must fill the empty space left behind them.

56
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:30,997
If a character is meant to move, then some parts of this character

57
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:34,450
are also to be added and drawn by us. In a moveless picture someone's 

58
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,267
can be hidden by another object but if the character is walking

59
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,251
the hand must be also drown by us.

60
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,712
Blinking is an ordinary case. We have to draw

61
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:44,656
Closed eyes, opened eyes and half-opened eyes.

62
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,037
I always try to assign as little work as I can

63
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,450
as it would be done faster, as I already now what is to be moved

64
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,228
And what is not. I just ask 

65
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:56,331
For this head to be cut and that part not to be.

66
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,029
This is what our artists do.

67
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:02,482
My task is to draw the lacking parts

68
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:05,974
and prepare all materials for the animation.

69
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:11,694
We use an open source program Krita for drawing and editing pictures.

70
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:16,534
I draw the characters, the position of eyes and mouth

71
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:21,337
the background and some other details 

72
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:26,297
for everything to be smooth and for the animator to be more comfortable to work.

73
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:31,077
Sometimes I have to edit some frames from the comic

74
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:36,672
and the changes can be quite dramatic.

75
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:40,680
Sometimes we can change the lighting 

76
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:45,521
or composition of the frame. For instance in the sixth scene

77
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,791
I am sorry I will have only four of them.

78
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,339
Rhrr!

79
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,847
Good morning, dearest sir!

80
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:57,085
We decided to remove the fruits and veg to make an emphasis on the character

81
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,497
There were too much details and the scene was too overloaded.

82
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:04,783
So we redesigned the market a bit

83
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:07,521
and extended the background to take a panoramic shot. 

84
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:10,537
It was very important to keep the author's style

85
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:15,482
and make it work with the other drawings in harmony.

86
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:23,497
Then we import all these pictures into Blender.

87
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:28,428
To scene has to be done right, everything must be prepared

88
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,642
for us to link the parts we need with the bones.

89
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,855
This is the work for a rigger and a scene assembler

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,243
In our team it is done by the same person.

91
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:47,664
For the preparing we use a plug-in call CoaTools.

92
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:56,394
The animators do the final version of what you will see on the screen.

93
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,990
The animating is the most labor-intensive step. Every single bit of attention

94
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:06,243
is being paid to creating of movements, for them to look good,

95
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:10,013
to fulfill the director's idea and fit the tempo

96
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,347
and composition of the animatic.

97
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,372
The animator works the movement trough and add some details.

98
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:21,397
If a character is walking then they must have their legs

99
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:26,918
arms, shoulders and head moving. And if they are speaking, they must have

100
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,955
their lips moving and eyes blinking,

101
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,272
The hair and clothes also move as the character moves.

102
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,891
We use the program Blender for the animating.

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,463
Blender is a powerful program for creating

104
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:46,455
3D animation and models. But we use it to create an animated comic.

105
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,216
It fits this purpose quite well..

106
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:55,264
Especially being used together with the plug-in called CoaTools.

107
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,331
There are some more peculiar things in our work. 

108
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:03,220
For example our animators also work with Particle Systems.

109
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,164
No point in drawing the smoke when we can create

110
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,093
a beautiful smoke simulation in two clicks.

111
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:13,537
Some really small details, small effects, particles and the wind.

112
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:18,299
We apply them to the backgrounds very often.

113
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,656
After the animation is finished, of course,

114
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:27,259
there will be a final voicing. The cartoon will be shown

115
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:30,910
the actors who will do the professional voice acting.

116
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:35,831
They record the voices which are to be mixed to the sound effects 

117
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,886
And only then we will have a finished cartoon.

118
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:47,091
The process of our production can be perfectly seen-trough.

119
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:52,086
We will leave a link in the description of this video. You can follow it

120
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:56,111
and see the list of tasks we are currently working on.

121
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:59,524
See precisely who is working on each one

122
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:03,291
track the process of its completing and the discussion in its topic.

123
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:09,864
For example there we can see a task for animating

124
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,889
we cal see all interim variants which are discussed with the director

125
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:18,328
And how we get this final variant.

126
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:22,970
Another example, here we have preparing of a picture for animation

127
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:28,804
There we have a precise task how to cut this picture.

128
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,906
The artist post the interim steps of the work

129
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,931
for everybody to be able to see and discuss it.

130
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:41,653
If something is wrong the director can intervene or make

131
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,780
some correction or say "everything is great"

132
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:50,599
At the moment we are working on the third episode. It's a simple one

133
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:54,511
if one were to compare it to the previous. However I think that it will take us

134
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:58,536
about four months to finish it. Which episode is to be done next

135
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,139
will be decided by voting of our sponsors

136
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:06,013
who support us on Patreon.

137
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:10,038
We will keep on tracking of the process of working on this episode

138
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:13,530
and the next ones. If you want to keep up with our work

139
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:17,181
you can follow us in social networks.

140
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,752
All the links are in description.

141
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:24,014
That was all. Thank you for your attention and see you later in the next episodes.

142
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,039
Goodbye!
